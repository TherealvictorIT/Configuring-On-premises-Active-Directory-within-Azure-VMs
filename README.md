<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)


<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

During this lab, we will set up two virtual machines (VMs) within the same virtual network (VNET). One VM will function as a Domain Controller (DC), while the other will serve as a client machine. To ensure seamless communication between the two, we will configure the DC with a static IP address, as it will be responsible for offering Active Directory services to the client machine. Additionally, we will join the client machine to the domain and configure its DNS settings to use the DC as its primary DNS server.


<h3>Ensure Connectivity between Client and Domain Controller</h3>

To verify connectivity, Client One will be connecting to DC-1 by attempting to ping it. Initially, the ping may fail due to the firewall on DC-1 blocking ICMPv4.

</p>
<p>
To resolve this issue, we will need to enable ICMPv4 on the DC-1 firewall.

</p>
<p>
After enabling ICMPv4, we can successfully ping DC-1 from Client-1.

<p>
Now we will log back into DC-1 to install AD Users & Computers. Promote the VM to DC, setup a new forest as "mydomain.com" afterwards restart then log back into DC-1 as user: "mydomain.com\labuser". If you performed the steps properly you should be able to run AD Users & Computers as shown below.

Excellent! We can start creating Organizational Units (OU). Let's first create an OU named _EMPLOYEES. Create another OU named _ADMINS. In order to do that right click on the domain area. Select new->Organizational Unit and fill out the field. Then click inside of your OU and right click, select new and select user and fill out the information for your new user. The user should be named Jane Doe, she is going to be an Admin so her username will be Jane_admin. Lastly add Jane to the domain admins security group.

From now on you can use Jane_admin as the administrator account. Now we will join Client-1 to the domain (mydomain.com) from the azure portal we will change client-1's DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address. After you do that restart Client-1 from within the Azure portal. Our picture below shows verification that client-1 is on the DC-1 DNS.

We have to join Client-1 to the domain in order to do so navigate to your system settings and go to about. Off to the right select rename this pc (advanced). From there select to change the domain. Enter "mydomain.com" after that enter your credentials from mydomain.com\labuser. Your computer will restart and then client-1 will be a part of mydomain.com
</p>

Wonderufl Client-1 is now a part of the domain. Now we will set up remote desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1. We have to log into Client-1 as an admin and open system properties. Click on "Remote Desktop", allow "domain users" access to remote desktop. After completing those steps you should be able to log into Client-1 as a normal user.
</p>

<p>
Lastly to verify that noraml users can RDP into Client-1 we will use a script to generate thousands of users into the domain. We will input the script in powershell, after the users are created we will select one and RDP into Client-1.

<p>
As you can see the Powershell script created a user with the username "bab.hubo" We were able to login to Client-1 with his credentials as a normal user.
